    print("The 'try except' is finished")
```

### - file processing

```python

# read a file
print(file.read()) # read the whole file

# read a file line by line
print(file.readline()) # read the first line

# read all lines
print(file.readlines()) # read all lines

# write to a file
file = open("file.txt", "w") # "w" means write only
file.write("Hello World")

# append to a file
file = open("file.txt", "a") # "a" means append only
file.write("Hello World")

# close a file
file.close()
```

### - codecs

```python
import codecs

# open a file
file = codecs.open("file.txt", "r", "utf-8") # "utf-8" means unicode

# read a file
print(file.read()) # read the whole file


# with statement (it will close the file automatically)
with codecs.open("file.txt", "r", "utf-8") as file:
    print(file.read()) # read the whole file
```

### - seek

```python
# open a file
file = open("file.txt", "r")

# seek to a position
file.seek(0) # seek to the beginning of the file

```

### - insert file

```python
# open a file
file = open("file.txt", "r")
file.insert(0, "Hello World") # it will insert "Hello World" to the beginning of the file
```

### - writelines

```python
# open a file
file = open("file.txt", "r")

# writelines
file = open("file.txt", "r")
file2 = open("file2.txt", "w")
file2.writelines(file.readlines()) # it will write all lines to the file
```

### - delete file

```python
import os

# delete a file
os.remove("file.txt")
